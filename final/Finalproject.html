<p>Summarized below is the emission data from spectroscopy run in the Zhu lab.</p>

<h3>Lambda max values</h3>
<p> On the graph above, the lambda max values are marked with a black dot. These wavelengths represent the wavelength at which the solution is emitted the largest amount of photons.</p>
<p>The lambda max values of emission are obtained by looking at a range of detection wavelengths while at one excitation wavelength. The lambda max can also be associated with a color of the visible light spectrum.</p>
<p>The lines in the graph are printed in the color that they correlate to based on its lambda max.</p>
